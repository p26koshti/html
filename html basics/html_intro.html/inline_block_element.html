<p style="border: 1px solid rgb(132, 245, 80)">hey koshti</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid rgb(58, 110, 221)">welcome</div>

<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

<!--
    this example was inline leval 
-->
<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid rgb(255, 56, 56)">koshti </span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

<p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
